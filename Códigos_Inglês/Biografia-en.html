    <!-- Early career -->
    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Early Career</h2>
      <p>
        Before debuting with a record label, Ado was active as an <em>utaite</em>, posting covers on Japanese video
        and audio platforms. Even in that phase she stood out for her dramatic interpretation, vocal range and the
        use of aggressive timbres in songs originally written for Vocaloid.
      </p>
      <p>
        On October 23, 2020 she made her commercial debut with the digital single <strong>“Usseewa”</strong>,
        produced by syudou. The song quickly broke out of the niche scene and gained major traction on streaming
        platforms, social media and music press.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Breakthrough -->
    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Breakthrough with “Usseewa”</h2>
      <p>
        “Usseewa” was a turning point in Ado’s career, marked by aggressive vocals and lyrics that express frustration
        with rigid social norms and everyday pressure. The song became a streaming phenomenon and reached the top
        of important Japanese charts such as the Oricon Digital Singles Chart and Billboard Japan Hot 100,
        according to widely reported data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its success sparked media and online debates about language, generation gaps and the limits of protest in pop,
        while establishing Ado as a new voice for young listeners who recognized themselves in that kind of discourse.

    <!-- Phases -->

      <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Debut Album & Career Phases</h2>

      <h3 class="h6 text-contrast-1 mb-2">Phase 1 — 2020–2021: “Usseewa” Era</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">
        After “Usseewa”, Ado released other high‑impact digital singles such as <strong>“Gira Gira”</strong> and
        <strong>“Odo”</strong>. This phase is marked by animated music videos, heavy use of illustrations and the
        maintenance of visual anonymity, which becomes part of her artistic identity.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h6 text-contrast-1 mb-2">Phase 2 — 2022: “Kyogen” and One Piece Film Red</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">
        On January 26, 2022, Ado released her first studio album <strong>“Kyogen (狂言)”</strong> through
        Universal Music Japan / Virgin Music. The record gathers tracks that explore themes such as social masks,
        inner conflict and criticism of hypocrisy, blending rock, pop and theatrical elements.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        Also in 2022, Ado became the singing voice of the character <strong>Uta</strong> in
        <strong>“One Piece Film Red”</strong>. Songs like <strong>“New Genesis (Shinjidai)”</strong>,
        <strong>“Backlight”</strong> and <strong>“Tot Musica”</strong> expanded her international reach and
        strengthened the association between her voice and anime productions.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h6 text-contrast-1 mb-2">Phase 3 — 2023 onwards: Arenas, Tours and Consolidation</h3>
      <p class="mb-0">
        From 2023, the artist started performing in large arenas, with elaborate stage productions,
        setlists combining digital hits and songs from <em>Kyogen</em> and <em>One Piece Film Red</em>,
        and stage design that preserves the mystery around her appearance. Later tours expanded to domes and
        large‑capacity venues, consolidating Ado as a headliner at major events.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Musical & Vocal Style</h2>
      <div class="row g-4">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>
            Ado is known for a wide vocal range, moving between powerful lows, strong mids and intense highs.
            Her performances are often described as theatrical, with the use of vocal drive, distortion and sudden
            dynamic changes to emphasize extreme emotions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>
            In terms of production, her tracks mix distorted guitars, heavy drums and electronic elements, with
            big choruses full of layered vocals. In film‑related works, orchestral arrangements and choirs also
            appear, reinforcing the epic character of the compositions.

    <!-- Themes & impact -->
    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Themes, Audience & Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Ado’s lyrics often address themes such as non‑conformity, criticism of oppressive environments,
        conflict between the “true self” and social roles, as well as more cinematic narratives in anime projects.
        These themes strongly resonate with young people facing school, work and social pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her cultural impact appears not only in streaming numbers and chart positions, but also in the amount of
        fanart, covers, remixes and discussions her songs generate on social networks and fan communities worldwide.
